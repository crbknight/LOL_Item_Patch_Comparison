# League of Legends Patch Comparison Tool

## About

This tool should be used in conjunction with my [other tool](https://github.com/crbknight/LOL_Item_Analyzer) which outputs a CSV file containing all of the items in a current patch as well as their gold efficiencies.

The tool will take two `.csv` files and output a `.txt` document showing all of the stat changes as well as how an item's gold efficiency changed.

## Dependencies

The only thing required for this tool to work is Python which can be downloaded from the [official site](https://www.python.org) or from the Microsoft Store.

## How to Use

Clone the repo by inputting the command `https://github.com/crbknight/LOL_Item_Patch_Comparison.git` into your CMD terminal.

After generating two `.csv` files using [this](https://github.com/crbknight/LOL_Item_Analyzer) tool, copy the new patch into the folder called `new_patch` and the old patch into the folder called `old_patch`. Then simply run the code to recieve an `output.txt` file 
with all of the changes.
